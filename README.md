# Olympic Medal Count by Country

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the performance of countries in the **Olympic Games** using historical data from [Kaggle Olympics Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/the-guardian/olympic-games).  

The goal is to compare **country-wise medal counts across years**, and explore patterns in **Summer vs Winter Olympics**, as well as **sport-wise dominance**.

## Dataset
- **athlete_events.csv** → Athlete-level Olympic data (1896–2016)  
- **noc_regions.csv** → Mapping of National Olympic Committee (NOC) codes to countries  

Source: [Kaggle Olympics Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/the-guardian/olympic-games)

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python** (Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook)  
- **pandas** → Data manipulation  
- **numpy** → Numerical operations  
- **matplotlib & seaborn** → Data visualization

## Analysis Highlights
 Country-wise medal tally (top 10 countries)  
 Medal trends across Olympic years  
 Heatmap of medals per country per year  
 Breakdown of **Gold, Silver, Bronze** medals  
 Comparison of **Summer vs Winter Olympics** performance

## Key Insights
- **USA** dominates Summer Olympics historically, especially in Athletics & Swimming.  
- **Norway, Canada, and Germany** lead in Winter Olympics.  
- Medal distributions show unique country strengths (e.g., China in Table Tennis, India in Hockey).  
- Olympic participation and medal counts have grown significantly over the years.
