# Olympic Medal Count by Country

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the performance of countries in the **Olympic Games** using historical data from [Kaggle Olympics Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/the-guardian/olympic-games).  

The goal is to compare **country-wise medal counts across years**, and explore patterns in **Summer vs Winter Olympics**, as well as **sport-wise dominance**.

## Dataset
- **athlete_events.csv** → Athlete-level Olympic data (1896–2016)  
- **noc_regions.csv** → Mapping of National Olympic Committee (NOC) codes to countries
